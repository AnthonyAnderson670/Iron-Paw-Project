				<p>My passion for metal fabrication, welding and automotive mechanics goes back to my childhood. My father was a welder and I've always enjoyed taking things apart to see how they work and putting them back together again to see if I can make them work better. In high school I concentrated on sports and skilled trades: welding, automotive, construction and small gas engines. After high school I took my talents to the local community college where I focused on Welding Technology.</p>
				<p>Upon graduating and receiving my Certificate in Welding Technology I was hired on as a Welding Instructor Adjunct. I spent nights and weekends teaching welding classes. This part-time teaching gig allowed me to strengthen my welding and mechanical skills by working full time in the metal fabrication and welding industry. I started off as a millwright and industrial mechanic. I quickly began earning many MIG and TIG welding certifications in the sanitary, ICAR automotive (certified as an administrator) and aerospace industries.</p>
				<p>I also began gaining experience working as a welder/fabricator, building classic cars and hot rods. As I worked for larger companies and local fab shops, running and building up their weld departments, I began to do side projects outside of my busy working and teaching hours. Quickly the side projects and repair work got too big for my garage, so I purchased a welder and a 12'x14' shed. That side work became so consistent by 2012 that  I had to become DBA as "Iron Paw Fabrication."</p>
				<p>Iron Paw quickly outgrew the shed and the workload became too heavy to only do outside of working hours. By 2014 we opened our shop full time at this location and by 2016 we became Iron Paw Inc. Bringing on a former student full time we began to grow! Lead Welder Billy is a part-time Welding Instructor Adjunct at a local private college that offers skilled trades programs. He is also an AWS D1.3 certified TIG welder (active on national registry), previously holding many MIG and TIG welding certifications.</p>
